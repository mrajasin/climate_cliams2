# Is Ocean Acidification Real?

## Summary of Middleton's *The Total Myth of Ocean Acidifcaiton* 
The main argument of this article is that ocean acidification is a process that has only recently been coined and which cannot happen in reality. The author starts by stating that ocean acidification is not a new concept and therefore must have been discussed prior to global warming (Middleton, 2018). After recounting several examples where the term *ocean acidification* was not found in the literature, Middleton states that only after 2003 was the term first stated. Next, the author moves on to discussing why ocean acidification cannot happen in reality. To try and prove this claim, Middleton proceeds to explain how despite the formation of acid in our oceans the pH of ocean water still measures above a value of seven units, thus keeping within the basic range (Middleton, 2018). Finally, the author addresses what he thinks is a flaw in the proposed relationship between pH and CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The current understanding is that an increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels would lead to a decrease in ocean water pH if all other environmental factors are held constant (Middleton, 2018). From this understanding, Middleton draws attention to the fact that in the real world there is no such thing as holding all other environmental factors constant, questioning the idea that our oceans will become acidic.

## Analysis of Middleton's Claim
The idea that our oceans will not become acidic was one which caught my attention. Due to the large volume of water in our oceans, it would make sense that a relatively smaller about of carbonic acid would not have a significant effect on our ocean’s acidity. Moreover, the idea that the ocean itself is not an isolated system questions whether the experimentally determined ocean acidity as a result of increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> represents the best- or worst-case scenario. With that said, turning to the literature, it becomes apparent that ocean acidification is real (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2015; NOAA, 2021). The ocean is said to be the moderator of climate change by absorbing large volumes of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (Hönisch et al., 2012; Gattuso, Mach and Morgan, 2013). By absorbing such a volume, changes in ocean water chemistry have been apparent. For example, in 200 years the pH of the ocean has decreased from 8.2 to 8.1 (NOAA, 2021; US EPA, 2016). While Middleton is correct in that a pH of 8.1 still lies within the basic range, he is wrong in that acidification is likely not happening. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale, meaning that a decrease of 0.1 pH units represents an approximate 30% increase in acidity—which is a significant change in terms of ocean acidity (NOAA, 2021; US EPA, 2016).
