# The Total ~~Myth~~ Truth of Ocean Acidification
__*By: Maya Rajasingham*__

## Summary of Middleton's *The Total Myth of Ocean Acidifcaiton* 
The main argument of this article is that ocean acidification is a term that has only recently been coined, and thus does not exist in our current reality. The author begins by claiming that the idea behind ocean acidification, that is, a relationship between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and seawater pH, is not new and must have discussed in the literature prior to the onset of modern global warming (Middleton, 2018). After recounting several examples where the term ocean acidification was not found in the literature, Middleton states that only after 2003 was the term first introduced. Next, the author moves on to a discussion outlining why ocean acidification is not part of our current reality. To try and prove this claim, Middleton proceeds to explain how despite the formation of acid in our oceans, the pH of ocean water still measures above a value of seven units, thus keeping it within the basic range (Middleton, 2018). Finally, the author addresses his perceived flaws in the proposed relationship between pH and CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The current understanding is that an increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels would lead to a decrease in ocean water pH, given all other environmental factors were held constant (Middleton, 2018). From this understanding, Middleton draws attention to the fact that in the real world there is no such thing as holding all other environmental factors constant, questioning the claim that our oceans will become acidic. 

## Analysis of Middleton's Claim
The idea that our oceans will not become acidic was one which caught my attention. Due to the large volume of water in our oceans, it seems plausible that a relatively small amount of carbonic acid would not have a significant effect on our ocean’s acidity. Moreover, the idea that the ocean itself is not an isolated system questions whether the experimentally determined ocean acidity, as a result of increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels, represents the best- or worst-case scenario. With that said, turning to the literature, it becomes apparent that ocean acidification is occurring (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2015; NOAA, 2021). The ocean is said to be the moderator of climate change by absorbing large volumes of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (Hönisch et al., 2012; Gattuso, Mach and Morgan, 2013). By absorbing such a volume, changes in ocean water chemistry have been apparent. For example, in 200 years the pH of the ocean has decreased from 8.2 to 8.1 (NOAA, 2021; US EPA, 2016). While Middleton is correct in that a pH of 8.1 still lies within the basic range, he is wrong in that acidification is likely not happening. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale, meaning that a decrease of 0.1 pH units represents an approximate 30% increase in acidity—which is a significant change in terms of ocean acidity (NOAA, 2021; US EPA, 2016). 

However, like Middleton suggests, there is uncertainty in our understanding of how multiple variables interact with each other to shape the future of our oceans. This idea was supported by Riebesell and Gattuso (2015), who state that when conducting multifactorial design experiments, it can become hard to draw conclusions as the acceptable range of values may differ from single- and multifactor studies. Thus, although we are able to determine how single factors such as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels influence ocean water pH, it is harder when multiple factors combine to influence the future of our ocean. Resolving such a problem will prove to be a significant milestone in understanding the breadth of ocean acidification (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2015).
